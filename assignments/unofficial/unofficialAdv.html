    <h2 class="white">Documentation:</h2>
    <div class="white">
      <p class="boxed">"Documentation is the best way to remember things you did a year ago."  It is easy to look up old code and see how you did things however,<br>
        it may not be clear why you did it a certain way.  There are so many important decisions to make in order to problem-solve your own code as<br>
        you write it, that you will probably not be able to remember the significance behind it.  Being able to write your code in prose will not only<br> reinforce your
        own understanding, but may very well provide you with a reason to pat your own back later on!<br>

        <h2 class="white">Vaulnerability:</h2>
        <p class="boxed">"Bring it down, then raise it up!"  This was in response to a question I asked about being the only female in a male-dominated feild.<br>
            These words were a response to a contexted in which I had expressed my frustration at feeling like the "weak link."  The gentlemen I<br>
            worked with had to reinforce all information I relayed it to them, but never questioned anything they said to one<br>
            another in the same mannor.  Her advice was to be vaulnerable; open a channel of communication that irradicates competitive vibes, or<br>
            unecessary expectations of one another.  Facilitate a space in which everyone can be genuine, human, and "self-aware".  "Then, raise it."<br>
            This means "set the standard," or be the change you want to see in the room.  If you want to be respected, you need to be taken seriously,<br>
            this means being the bigger person, working with your heart and NOT your ego.</p>
