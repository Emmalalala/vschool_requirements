                    and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention."

                    <p>People are commonly allied with exercise in fighting cardiovascular disease. Lanier, Bury, and Richardson commence
                    their topic with “cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States,” (1), and continues
                    to include helpful information on dieting that benefits said mortality rate.  It is under the subheading “physical activity”
                    (3) they state “a meta-data analysis of prospective cohort studies estimated that reducing the time spent sitting to less than
                    three hours per day would result in a two-year increase in average life expectancy” (3).  This is gathered from the data that
                    proves activity reduces risk of CVD, “any physical activity [that] is associated with lower cardiovascular risk… the benefit
                    increases as the amount of weekly physical activity increases” (4).  This article provides data and a thorough overview of the
                    decrease in mortality for those who practice some regular exercise, also giving insight on how it complements medication in the
                    particular case of CVD.

            Promotion in the Healthcare System." Mayo Clinic Proceedings 8 Dec.</em>

            <p>Vuori, Lavie, and Blair offer insight into the particular adoptions of physical activity 
            and exercise training within the healthcare system.   Indeed, their opening statement includes “because exercise is medicine, it should be
            seen and dealt with in the same ways as pharmaceuticals and other medical interventions…,” addressing the importance of physical activity and 
            exercise training and the belief that both should be prescribed in certain amounts, depending on the nature of the illness and physical condition 
            of the patients, in the same fashion as drugs. The article continues, specifying that “Physical activity is an essential biological stimulus 
            for the development and maintenance of healthy structures and functions of the human body,” conveying that even without a condition, activity is 
            beneficial for maintaining health.  The authors also attend to problems under the subheading “factors that favor and hinder advising on physical 
            activity/exercise training in the healthcare system,” stating that patients must have some kind of follow-up supervision to ensure their continued 
            practice of activity.  The authors suggest, “Some evidence suggests that the advising provided by allied healthcare professionals alone or in conjunction 
            with physicians produce better long-term effects than that provided by physicians alone,” physical therapy is important to motivate bodily maintenance over 
            an extended period of time, especially during a period of recovery.  Vuori, Lavie, and Blair strongly advocate exercise in appropriate daily amounts, 
            providing conclusive data from independent studies that claim that facilitation of activity and making people aware of the benefits of exercise is 
            overlooked by the health care system.  It must therefore become prioritized through the education of health professionals to promote their advocacy 
            in recognition of the importance of exercise.

            of Medicine 29 May 2014: 905. Print. 04 Mar. 2017</em></p>
            <span></span>
            <p>Alpert provides his summary of information about the benefits of exercise as a part of cardiovascular disease prevention and general recovery. 
            Exercise has shown “...improvement in mood and cognition, self-esteem, energy levels and endurance, sleep quality, muscle strength, atherosclerosis 
            risk factors, cardiac function in healthy individuals and in patients with heart failure, regular bowel function, fertility, serum lipid profiles, 
            immune system function, offspring health, and joint mobility” (1) many beneficial properties.  The author relates “I know of no other therapeutic 
            intervention that results in so many positive effects” (1).   In the realm of recovery, “physiological benefits include lowered myocardial oxygen 
            demand, improved coronary blood-flow and endothelial function, and increased production of endothelial progenitor cells” (1), the benefits reduce 
            the instance of re-injury.  Though the benefits of physical activity may not be so readily perceived, they are proven to be an accurate method of 
            disease prevention, as the author concludes “... exercise is just as important as medication…” (1).  Alpert advocates that exercise be treated as 
            medicine, arguing that benefits cover a margin that medications by themselves have not reached.</p>

            <p><em>Myers, Jonathan , PhD. "New American Heart Association/American College of 
            Cardiology Guidelines on Cardiovascular Risk: When Will Fitness Get the 
            Recognition it Deserves?" Mayo Clinic Proceedings 03 Feb. 2014: 722. Print. 03 Mar. 2017</em></p>
            <span></span>
            <p>This article by Myers documents the meeting of the two most credible sources of cardiovascular knowledge.  He says the New American Heart 
            Association and the American College of Cardiology are organizations “...among the most experienced and qualified to develop guidelines, and 
            their guidelines and scientific statements set the standard for clinical practice,” to be trusted.  This article explains that though their guidelines 
            specify the importance of diet and exercise in the prevention of disease and recovery process, their interview is mainly about the use of drugs (such 
            as statins.)  Myers emphasises how physical activity and exercise training is overlooked, indicating how it was barely mentioned when two top-credible 
            sources presented their studies, exposing the bias of the doctors themselves.</p>
